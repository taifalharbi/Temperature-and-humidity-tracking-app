# temperature-humidity

As temperature and humidity are important parameters in the surrounding environment, this project aims to measure temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor. Also, using the HC-06 Bluetooth module to send data read by the sensor to the Blynk App, which will offer a more human-friendly interface designed by the programmer to read the data, Moreover, there will be two LEDs, representing a feedback system. 
The feedback system will work as follows: If the temperature exceeds 25, the red led illuminates; if the humidity exceeds 30%, the green led illuminates. The readings will be updated every 30 seconds.
